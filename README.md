# seismology-lab-odin

Seismology Lab of 5th semester as Geophysics Student in Gadjah Mada University.
Dedicated repository to reviewing things I learned while
learning code in Odin.

## Plans of contents

1. Calculate distance and azimuth (and back azimuth) between 2 points on earth surface with respect to Nort Pole which essential to;
    - Pre-processing location of earthquake source (assumed to be any known location on earth) that being recorded by seismogram in certain locations i.e. source-stations
    - Later be used when determine locatioon of earthquake
